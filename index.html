                        <div class="col-12"><a href="http://localhost:5500/CV/">Image Colorizer </a><i style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal;">(Sep 2024)</i><p>In the Image Colorizer project, the primary challenge was to accurately colorize grayscale images while preserving the original image's details and texture. To tackle this, I employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, utilizing a dataset of over 50,000 grayscale and color image pairs for training. By implementing advanced techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning from pre-trained models, I improved the colorization accuracy, achieving a PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) increase of 25% compared to baseline methods, resulting in visually appealing outputs that closely matched the ground truth.</p></div>
                        <div class="col-12"><a href="http://localhost:5500/CV/">Deep Convolutional Generative Adverserial Neural Network</a> <i style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal;">(March 2024)</i><p>During the development of the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN), I faced the challenge of generating high-quality images that closely resembled the training dataset. Initial outputs were often blurry and lacked detail. To address this, I fine-tuned the network's hyperparameters, increased the complexity of the generator and discriminator architectures, and employed techniques like batch normalization and dropout. These adjustments led to a remarkable 30% improvement in the Inception Score, indicating a significant enhancement in image quality and diversity.</p></div>
                        <div class="col-12"><a href="http://localhost:5500/CV/">Breast Cancer Segmentation</a> <i style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal;">(April 2024)</i><p>In the Breast Cancer Segmentation project, the challenge lay in accurately segmenting cancerous regions from histopathological images, which often contained significant noise and variability. To overcome this, I utilized U-Net architecture specifically designed for biomedical image segmentation and trained the model on a dataset of 2,000 annotated images. By implementing preprocessing steps such as contrast enhancement and using advanced augmentation techniques, I achieved a Dice Coefficient of 0.85, significantly improving the segmentation accuracy and enabling more precise identification of cancerous tissues.</p></div>
                        <div class="col-12"><a href="http://localhost:5500/CV/">Hand Written Number Prediction</a> <i style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal;">(Feb 2024)</i><p>The Handwritten Number Prediction project faced challenges with classifying noisy and poorly written digits from the MNIST dataset. To enhance model performance, I implemented a CNN model and applied techniques such as image normalization, dropout, and data augmentation, effectively addressing overfitting and improving model robustness. As a result, the model achieved a test accuracy of 98.5%, surpassing the traditional accuracy rates for similar tasks and demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing handwritten digits under varied conditions.</p></div>
